## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Push failed - Authentication

```bash
# Use GitHub personal access token
# Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Generate token with 'repo' scope
# Use token as password when pushing
```

### Issue: Tag already exists

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v2.0.0

# Delete remote tag (if pushed)
git push origin :refs/tags/v2.0.0

# Recreate tag
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0 - Video Export Feature"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

### Issue: Large file upload timeout

If ZIP upload times out:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try uploading during off-peak hours
3. Consider uploading via GitHub CLI
4. Split release notes into smaller sections

### Issue: "Connection refused" or network errors

- Check internet connectivity
- Verify GitHub is accessible: https://github.com
- Try again after a few minutes
- Check firewall/proxy settings
