## Camera Configuration Tips

- **Verify credentials**: Use VLC or `ffplay` to confirm IP, username, password, and stream path before configuring the app.
- **Prefer TCP**: Many consumer IP cameras are unreliable over UDP; keep **Force TCP** enabled unless the camera vendor recommends otherwise.
- **Mind network latency**: For remote cameras, increase `buffer_frames` (e.g., to 6-8) if you frequently see reconnect messages.
- **Deal with overnight lighting**: Configure the camera's own exposure or IR settings; the app captures whatever the RTSP feed delivers.
- **Multiple cameras**: Copy `config/camera_config_example.json` per device and load them through the GUI to swap configurations quickly.
- **Security**: Store configs in a protected location if the RTSP password is sensitive; the app saves the password in plain text JSON.
- **Prevent camera timeouts**: Enable **Proactive Reconnect** to maintain 100% capture success rate. Most IP cameras have firmware timeouts (typically 5-10 minutes). Set the reconnect interval to ~40 seconds before your camera's timeout for uninterrupted captures.

### Optimal Settings for Annke I81EM Cameras

Based on extensive testing with Annke I81EM IP cameras, two configurations are recommended depending on your needs:

**Camera Settings (Web Interface) - Same for Both Configurations:**
- Frame Rate: `10 FPS` (provides fresh frames without overwhelming buffer)
- I Frame Interval: `4` (keyframe every 0.4 seconds for accurate timestamps)
- Max Bitrate: `3072 Kbps` or lower (stable streaming over network)

#### Configuration: Maximum Timestamp Accuracy (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most timelapse applications where timestamp precision matters

**Application Settings:**
- Capture Interval: `30 seconds`
- Buffer Frames: `1` (minimal buffer for freshest frames)
- Proactive Reconnect: `300 seconds` (5 minutes - before 460s camera timeout)
- Force TCP: `Enabled` (required for stability)

**Performance Results:**
- 100% capture success rate
- Timestamp accuracy: **±5 seconds** (stable throughout session) - 96% improvement over baseline
- Extremely stable and predictable behavior
- No drift accumulation over time
- Lower system overhead
- 120 frames per hour

#### Performance Comparison: Baseline vs v2.3.0

| Metric | Baseline (Pre-v2.3.0) | v2.3.0 Multi-threaded | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Timestamp Accuracy (initial)** | +35 seconds | +19 seconds | **46% better** |
| **Timestamp Accuracy (steady)** | -4m 50s (-290s) | ±5 seconds | **96% better** |
| **Drift stability** | Accumulates over time | Stable (no accumulation) | **Major improvement** |
| **Success rate** | 100% | 100% | Maintained |
| **Frames per hour** | 120 frames | 120 frames | Same |
| **System overhead** | Moderate | Low | **Reduced** |

**Recommendation:** Version 2.3.0's multi-threaded bufferless capture achieves exceptional ±5 second timestamp accuracy with zero drift accumulation, making it ready for all timelapse applications requiring timestamp precision.

**Note:** Other Annke models may have different timeout intervals. Test your camera's behavior and adjust the proactive reconnect interval to ~40 seconds before the observed timeout.

---

## Testing & Automation

- `tests/test_backend.py` exercises configuration management and capture logic with interactive prompts.
- `tests/test_backend_auto.py` runs the same checks without user input (connection tests will fail harmlessly if no camera is reachable).
- `tests/test_video_export.py` validates the export pipeline; provide a populated `snapshots/YYYYMMDD` folder before running it.

---

## Build & Release

- `build_release.bat` builds a PyInstaller executable and packages a release folder (optionally bundling FFmpeg).
- `bundle_ffmpeg.bat` copies FFmpeg/FFprobe into the release bundle.
- `RTSP_Timelapse.spec` defines the PyInstaller build (GUI-only executable with bundled resources).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Connection Issues

**Cannot connect to camera:**
- Verify camera IP with `ping 192.168.0.101`.
- Test stream URL in VLC: `rtsp://user:pass@ip/stream1`.
- Check port 554 (RTSP) is not blocked by firewall.
- Enable **Force TCP** option if using UDP causes dropouts.

**Connection drops frequently:**
- Enable **Force TCP** for more stable connections.
- Enable **Proactive Reconnect** to reconnect before camera timeout (recommended: 420 seconds for Annke cameras).
- Check network stability between PC and camera.
- Increase capture interval to reduce request frequency.
- Check camera settings for session timeout/keepalive options.
- If drops occur at exact intervals (e.g., every 460 seconds), this is a camera firmware timeout - use proactive reconnect set to ~40 seconds before the timeout.

### Video Export Issues

**FFmpeg not found:**
- Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- Add to system PATH **or** place in `bin/` folder next to executable.
- Ensure all FFmpeg DLL files are present (~150 MB total).
- Click **Test FFmpeg** button to verify installation.

**Export is slow:**
- Lower resolution (720p or 480p instead of original).
- Increase CRF quality value (23-28 for smaller files).
- Use speed multiplier (2×, 4×) to skip frames.
- Close other applications to free system resources.

**Video won't play:**
- Ensure using MP4 format (most compatible).
- Try opening in VLC media player.
- Check FFmpeg log for encoding errors.

### Performance Issues

**GUI is slow or laggy:**
- Disable live preview (uncheck "Enable Preview").
- Lower JPEG quality (70-80 instead of 90).
- Increase capture interval (30s+ instead of 20s).
- Close background applications.

**Disk filling up:**
- Monitor available disk space regularly.
- Lower JPEG quality to reduce file sizes.
- Delete old snapshots after exporting to video.
- Use "Storage Saver" preset for smaller video files.

**Disk Space Calculator:**
```
At quality 90, each 1280×720 frame ≈ 400 KB

Formula: (3600 / interval) × hours × 0.4 MB

Example: 20s interval for 8 hours
  = (3600/20) × 8 × 0.4
  = 576 MB for images
  + ~50 MB for final video
  = ~625 MB total
```

## System Requirements

**Minimum:**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or Linux/macOS
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4 GB RAM
- 2 GB free disk space
- Network connection to RTSP camera

## Q&A

**Q: Can I use multiple cameras?**
A: Currently supports one camera per instance. Run multiple instances for multiple cameras. Save different configs and load them via **File → Load Configuration**.

**Q: Does it work on Linux/macOS?**
A: Yes! The Python source is cross-platform. Install dependencies and FFmpeg for your OS. Windows releases include pre-built executables.

**Q: Can I run it headless (no GUI)?**
A: Not currently. The legacy CLI version (`src/main.py`) exists but isn't maintained. The GUI is recommended.

**Q: What RTSP URL format do I use?**
A: Depends on your camera brand. See [Camera Settings](#camera-settings) for common paths. Test with VLC first: `rtsp://user:pass@ip/path`.

**Q: My camera requires a specific port. How do I set it?**
A: Include port in IP address field: `192.168.0.101:8554`

**Q: What's the best preset for YouTube?**
A: Use **"Web Optimized"** (30fps, 720p) or **"High Quality 30fps"** (original resolution).

**Q: How do I make a very fast timelapse?**
A: Use **"Ultra Speed 16×"** preset or set Speed Multiplier to 8×/16×/32×.

**Q: Can I add music to the video?**
A: Not built-in. Use video editing software (like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, or OpenShot) to add audio after export.

**Q: Why are my original files safe?**
A: The export creates temporary numbered copies in a `.temp_export_*/` folder. Your originals are never renamed or modified. The temp folder is automatically deleted after export.

**Q: What is Proactive Reconnect and should I use it?**
A: Proactive Reconnect automatically disconnects and reconnects to the camera at a scheduled interval **before** the camera's firmware timeout occurs. This prevents failed captures during timeout periods. Enable it if you notice connection drops at regular intervals (e.g., every 5-10 minutes). Set the value to ~40 seconds before your camera's timeout. For Annke I81EM cameras, use 420 seconds (7 minutes).

**Q: How do I know what reconnect interval to use?**
A: Monitor your logs for "Connection lost" messages. If they occur at regular intervals (e.g., exactly every 460 seconds), that's your camera's timeout. Set Proactive Reconnect to that value minus 40 seconds. Example: 460s timeout → use 420s reconnect interval.

**Q: Why are my snapshot timestamps off by 30 seconds?**
A: This is normal! The timestamp in the filename is when the capture was initiated. The timestamp embedded by the camera in the image is when the frame was encoded. With optimal settings (10 FPS, I-frame 4), this difference should be 5-33 seconds with Configuration A (30s/300s) or 33s-4min with Configuration B (20s/420s). This is acceptable for timelapse purposes.

**Q: What capture interval should I use?**
A: **30-second intervals are optimal** for balancing timestamp accuracy, frame rate, and system performance. Based on extensive testing documented in `docs/TIMESTAMP_ACCURACY_ANALYSIS.md`:

**Experimental Results (60s vs 30s intervals):**
- **Post-reconnect accuracy**: 30s achieves **+23s drift** vs 60s achieves **-7s drift**
- **Sign flip significance**: Positive drift (+23s) means fresher frames vs negative drift (-7s) means stale frames
- **Frame density**: 30s provides **120 frames/hour** vs 60s provides only 60 frames/hour
- **Staleness accumulation**: 30s accumulates drift at **half the rate** of 60s intervals
- **Reliability**: Both achieve **100% capture success rate**

**Why 30s is better:**
The buffer staleness accumulates proportionally to the capture interval. At 30s intervals, frames are captured twice as often, so the buffer never gets as stale as with 60s intervals. The positive post-reconnect drift (+23s) indicates the captured frame is only 23 seconds old, versus 60s intervals where negative drift (-7s) indicates frames from the bottom of a stale buffer.

**When to adjust:**
- **Faster scenes** (clouds, traffic): Use 20s for 180 frames/hour (more storage needed)
- **Slower scenes** (construction, plants): 30s is perfect for 120 frames/hour
- **Very slow scenes** (astronomy, shadows): 60s for 60 frames/hour is acceptable

v2.3.0 ships with **30s as the default** - optimized for the best balance of accuracy and performance.

**Q: What does timestamp accuracy mean for my timelapse?**
A: Timestamp accuracy is the difference between the **filename timestamp** (when your PC saved the file) and the **camera-embedded timestamp** (when the camera actually encoded that frame).

**Why it matters:**
- **Visual continuity**: Frames should represent actual temporal progression, not stale buffered frames
- **Scientific applications**: Astronomical/weather timelapses need accurate time correlation
- **Quality indicator**: Large drift (minutes) indicates buffering issues in your setup

**v2.3.0 Performance:**
With the new multi-threaded bufferless capture, you get:
- **±5 seconds steady-state accuracy** (vs baseline -4m 50s, that's 96% improvement)
- **Zero drift accumulation** across the entire session
- **Stable accuracy** even after multiple reconnection cycles

**For timelapse playback:**
Even with older versions showing 1-2 minute drift, this is **visually imperceptible** when played at 24-30 fps. Your timelapse will look smooth and continuous.

**For scientific/critical applications:**
v2.3.0's ±5 second precision is suitable for:
- Weather pattern analysis
- Astronomical observations
- Construction documentation with precise time-stamping
- Any application requiring sub-minute accuracy

The days of worrying about timestamp drift are over with v2.3.0!

**Q: How do I learn what each setting does?**
A: Simply hover your mouse over any control (button, input field, checkbox, etc.) and wait ~500ms. A helpful tooltip will appear explaining what it does, expected values, and recommendations. The app has 37 tooltips covering every important control.

**Q: Can I disable tooltips?**
A: Tooltips are built into the interface and cannot be disabled. However, they only appear when you hover for 500ms, so they won't interfere with normal usage. They disappear instantly when you move your mouse away.
